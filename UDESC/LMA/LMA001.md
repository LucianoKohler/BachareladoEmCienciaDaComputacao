# Propositions

Propositions are sentences that can assume one of two values: True or False, these are widely used on the computer science/math areas to create allegations that may help to get to a research's objective.

propositions need to be **EXACT**, not having any ambiguities, having a clear and direct message while also being **ATOMIC**

*Example*

The sky is blue
- Correct proposition

The sky is a little blue but sometimes orange and can assume different colors sometimes
- Incorrect proposition

To fix this proposition, we can atomize it, which means making it simpler, and thus, clearer to read

The sky is a little blue and sometimes orange, but never pink
  - The sky is a little blue
  - The sky is sometimes orange
  - The sky cannot be pink

Atomic, clear, and not ambiguous.

We usually link a prop with a letter, for example, P, Q, R, S... In order to compact things and make formulas better to read, look at this formula:

¬(A v B) ^ (C ^ D)

Writing each sentence instead of a letter would be REALLY bad, so just use letters.

# Proposition characters

Propositions can have characters that may change the result of a formula, those are:

- (¬)  Negation - Not
- (^)  Conjunction - And
- (v)  Disjunction - Or
- (->) Implication - If, then


- Negation is simple, it reverses the value of a prop, if True, False, and if False, True.

- And retruns True if BOTH of the values inside it are True, if one of them is False, no Trues for you.

- Or can have two meaning, the **inclusive** OR, which may be true if A, B or AB be true, and the **exclusive** OR, which will only be true if exactly ONE of the terms is True.

- The worst of them, Implication, is better explained with an example:
  - If it rains, I will grab an Umbrella

  - A = If it rains
  - B = I will grab an umbrella
  - A -> B

- If A is True, B will ALWAYS be True, but if A is False, B can be both True or False, since I didn't say anything about what will happen if it doesn't rain, I don't care :)
