# Pushing A Local Repository to Github
*Credits: Great [Teacher Renan Ponick](https://www.youtube.com/@theinitcode/videos)*

If you have a loacl repository, but you don't know how to send it to the *Github*'s cloud, take a look on this step-by-step and do it easily:

- With the file ready to push (with the desired informations), open your terminal (example made on VSCode) with `ctrl + "` or `ctrl + shift + "` to create a new terminal, **Make sure that the path is located on your files' folder**;

- Type `git init` on your terminal to initialize a rep on your device;

- Then, `git add .` to save new files and/or cahnges made on the local rep;

- After that, do the classic *commit* with the command `git commit -m "Description"` to save that code's version on the local rep;

- Now on the "Source Control" tab on the VSCode, click on the send button to send the local rep to the remote rep;

- Go back and forth between the browser and VSCode to get all permissions OK and, after all, choose if the rep will be private or public;

- To send future changes to the remote rep, just use `git push`.
